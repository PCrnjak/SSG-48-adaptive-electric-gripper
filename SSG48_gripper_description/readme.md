## URDF → MJCF derivation steps

1. Loaded the URDF into MuJoCo and saved a corresponding MJCF.
2. Manually edited the MJCF to extract common properties into the `<default>` section.
3. Added position-controlled actuators for the arm.
4. Added `scene.xml` which includes the robot, with a textured groundplane, skybox, and haze.
