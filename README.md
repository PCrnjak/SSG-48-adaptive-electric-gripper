**SSG-48 adaptive electric gripper** is a gripper based on [Spectral micro BLDC drivers](https://source-robotics.com/products/spectral-micro-bldc-controller). It is a gripper capable of controlling its gripping force, making it perfect for assembly tasks and human-robot collaboration. Force can be adjusted from 2 N to 35 N allowing you to grasp a wide range of items; from delicate and soft to rigid and sturdy.

Mechanical files and firmware are open source allowing you to add a custom griping tool and attach it to any robotic arm or robot. Gripper software is also open-source. Gripper has a stroke of 48 mm and a mass of 400g.
